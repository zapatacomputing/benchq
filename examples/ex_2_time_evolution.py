"""
Example showing how to estimate the resources required to run a time evolution
algorithm. It shows two different ways of estimating the resources: one with gate
synthesis performed at the circuit level, while the other one does it during the
measurement phase. The first is more accurate and leads to lower resources,
but is also more expensive in terms of runtime and memory usage.

Most of the objects has been described in the `1_from_qasm.py` examples, here
we only explain new concepts.

WARNING: This example requires the pyscf extra as well as the sdk extra.
run `pip install benchq[pyscf]` then `pip install benchq[sdk]` from the
main to install the extras. Then run `orq start` to start local ray.

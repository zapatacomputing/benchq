"""
Objectives:

1. Have a "benchq" script, which takes in a circuit and outputs a resource estimate
    - Prototype, but needs to make sense in principle.
    - Well defined I/Os


2. Have a "darpa-1.5" script, which creates a circuit from an application instance.
    - This is mostly for completeness and illustratory purposes
    - Software can be quite crappy

# This examples shows three ways of performing resource estimation:
# 1. Generating the whole circuit, creating a graph out of it and performing
#   estimation on it
# 2. Using Quantum Program, performing estimation on the subcircuits
#   and then combining them together
# 3. Using Quantum Program, recreating the full graph from it, and then
#   performing resource estimation on it
#
# The first method is a reference, as it does not involve any simplification,
# it represents the exact result. However, given the size of the target circuits
# it's not scalable.
#
# The second method does not explicitly create the whole circuit, but uses the quantum
# program and subcircuits. For each subcircuit it creats a graph and then joins all
# the graphs together to recreate the graph of the full circuit. Ideally,
# the recreated graph should exactly match the ful graph from the previous
# example (up to local clifford transformations). However, at this point the method
# for recreating graph is imperfect, so it might introduce some approximations.

# The third method creates only the subgraphs for each subroutine in a quantum program,
# and the creates resource estimation based on them, without explicitly recreating
# the full graph. It is the least accurate from all threee, as it introduces
# certain assumptions, so should be treated as an upper bound on the resources needed.
# However, it is also the fastest and the least resource intensive.

# At this stage of development we are aware that there are some issues with methods
# 2 and 3 and they do not necessarily yield correct results.

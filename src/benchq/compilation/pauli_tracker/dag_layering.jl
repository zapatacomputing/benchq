Given a pauli tracker and an ASG, calculate the order in which qubits
have to be measured. This is done by creating a DAG of the qubits which
depend on each other. We then find a layering of this DAG based on the
layering_optimization parameter. The layering is then stored in the
pauli_tracker object.

        information on the conditional Pauli operators and measurements
        performed on each qubit.

    ignored_nodes (Vector{Qubit}): The nodes which should be ignored when
        calculating the layering. This is used when calculating the
        layering for a subgraph.

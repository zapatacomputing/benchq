# benchq

## What is it?

`benchq` estimates the required resources for performing a fault-tolerant computation using surface codes. It works with various inputs, such as circuits, openfermion QubitOperators, and pyscf files. Given correct input, `benchq` will return a list of resources required to perform the selected algorithm such as the required number of physical qubits, error rate, wall time, etc.

`benchq` was developed as a part of [DARPA Quantum Benchmarking program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/quantum-benchmarking).

## Installation

To install `benchq` run `pip install .` from the main directory.
It's been tested with Python 3.8-3.9 on macOS and Linux.

Known limitation: installation can fail because of a problem with `pyscf`, one of our transitive dependencies.
If you're a Windows user, please consider using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). On other systems you can try installing `pyscf` directly from its git repo: `pip install git+https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf@v2.0.1`.

### Extra dependencies

Graph compilation requires non-Python dependencies to be installed.
1. Install a recent Julia version from the [Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Make sure `julia` executable is on your `$PATH`. You can test it by running `julia` in a new terminal window.
3. Install Julia dependencies: open `julia` REPL, press `]`, run `add JSON` and `add Jabalizer`.

To run resource estimation for Microsoft, one needs to have Microsoft Resource Estimation package configured. I'm not sure if that's even possible for a general audience at the moment.

## Usage

Please take a look at the `examples` directory. 
We have multiple examples there:
- `h_chain_te.py` shows how to use graph state compilation on a simple hydrogen chain example
- `h_chain_qasm.py` shows how to use graph state compilation when the circuit is loaded from QASM
- `qsp_vlasov.py` shows how to perform resource estimation 


## Development and Contribution

To install the development version, run `pip install -e '.[dev]'` from the main directory. (if using MacOS, you will need single quotes around the []. If using windows, or Linux, you might not need the quotes).

We use [Google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) docstring format. If you'd like to specify types please use [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) type hints instead adding them to docstrings.

There are codestyle-related [Github Actions](.github/workflows/style.yml) running for PRs. (TODO)

- If you'd like to report a bug/issue please create a new issue in this repository.
- If you'd like to contribute, please create a pull request to `main`.

### Running tests

Unit tests for this project can be run using `make coverage` command from the main directory.
Alternatively you can also run `pytest .`.

### Style

We are using automatic tools for style and type checking. In order to make sure the code is compliant with them please run: `make style` from the main directory (this requires `dev` dependencies).
